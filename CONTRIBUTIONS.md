# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To clarify the terms under which your contributions are made, please review and agree to the following:

## Copyright and License Grant

* You retain the copyright in your contributions.
* By submitting a contribution, you grant the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and relicense your contribution under any license terms, including open-source and proprietary licenses.

## Certification

By contributing, you certify that:

* The contribution is your original work, or you have the right to submit it. 
* You are not knowingly infringing on anyone else’s intellectual property. 
* You have the authority to grant this license (for example, if your employer owns your work, you have their permission).

## Ways of Working (WoW)

Before starting any work:
* Ensure the task is part of the project's roadmap and scope.
* Contact the maintainers to discuss the task from both a technical and UI/UX perspective.
* Familiarize yourself with the project’s design principles and code style.

Contribution process:
* Large pull requests (PRs) will not be accepted.
* It is the contributor's responsibility to communicate early (peer programming, issues, discussions, or draft PRs).
* Complex matters are better discussed in person using video-calls and screen sharing.

These guidelines exist to respect the time and effort of both contributors and maintainers, ensuring efficient, collaborative and respectful development and communication.

## No Warranty
Contributions are provided "as-is," without warranty of any kind.

By submitting a contribution, you agree to this CLA. No additional paperwork is required.
