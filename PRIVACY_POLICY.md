# Zimly: Privacy policy

## Data collected by the app

This app refrains from collecting or sharing any privacy-sensitive data or personally identifiable information.

No trackers or analytics software are installed.

It accesses locally stored media, documents and media location data solely for the purpose of backing up that data to a user-defined remote storage.

All user configurations are stored on the device only and can be deleted by uninstalling the app.

Data in transit is encrypted using SSL (https) unless the user opts out and configures their remote storage differently.
